# petshop_kubernetes

These repositories are the implementations that correspond to a series of whitepapers written to 
detail how developers can take a legacy ASP.NET application, developed as a monolith, and redesign, re-architect,
and re-platform it to run as a cloud-native application using microservices architecture and Kubernetes.

An introduction to the series can be found here on the Google Cloud Platform Blog:
